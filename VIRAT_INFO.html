    <h3>
        <p> Virat Kohli is an Indian
            cricketer who is the current captain of the India national team. He plays for Delhi in domestic
            cricket
            and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as the right-handed batsman. <br>  He
            is
            widely considered one of the world's best batsmen. <br>
    
            Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. A few months
            later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played
            as a
            reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular middle-order batsman in
            the
            ODI and was part of the squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011
            and
            shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South
            Africa.
            Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in
            2013,
            Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC
            World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).</p>
    
        <p>
            Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy
            following MS Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. <br> In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain
            after
            Dhoni stepped down from the position. <br> In ODIs, Kohli has the second-highest number of centuries and
            the
            highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record for being the
            fastest
            batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket. He also holds the world
            record
            of being the fastest to 23,000 international runs.
